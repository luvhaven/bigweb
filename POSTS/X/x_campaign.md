# X (Twitter) Campaign: Contrarian Truths & Speed

> **Strategy:** Twitter is for the cynical intellectual. We need to be sharp, brief, and polarizing. "Threads" are the value vehicle. Ads must be short punch-in-the-face statements.

## 🧵 Post 1: The "Death of Web Design" Thread (Contrarian)
**Tweet 1:**
Web Design is dead. 💀

If you are paying $20k for "pretty pixels" in 2025, you are getting scammed.

The future isn't design. It's **Psychology + Architecture.**
Here are 5 reasons why your beautiful website is failing (and how to fix it). 🧵👇

**Tweet 2:**
1. The 3-Second Rule.
Your "fade-in" animation takes 1.5 seconds.
Your heavy images take 2 seconds.
The user left at 2.8 seconds.
Pretty doesn't matter if nobody sees it.
Speed > Aesthetics. Always.

**Tweet 3:**
2. The "Fold" is a lie.
People scroll. But they only scroll if you give them a dopamine hit at the top.
If your Hero section is just a stock photo and "Welcome to [Company]", you lost.
You need a Hook. A conflict. A promise.

**Tweet 4:**
3. AI isn't a feature. It's mandatory.
If you don't have an AI agent capturing leads at 3 AM...
You are letting money walk out the door.
It costs $50/mo to run. It brings in $50k/mo in value. The ROI is infinite.

**Tweet 5:**
4. The "Contact Us" friction.
Nobody wants to fill out a form with 12 fields.
Use Typeform logic.
Use "Click to Call."
Use Magic Links.
Reduce friction to ZERO.

**Tweet 6:**
The Solution?
Stop building websites. Start building **Revenue Systems.**
We use Next.js + AI to build sites that print money.

## 🐦 Post 2: The "Hard Truth" (One-Liner)
**Tweet:**
Your website isn't an "expense."
It's an employee that works 24/7/365.
If it's not bringing you leads... fire it.
(And hire us).
