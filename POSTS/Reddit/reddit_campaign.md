# Reddit Campaign: The "Anti-Marketing" Value Play

> **Strategy:** Do NOT "sell." Redditors smell sales pitches a mile away. Provide immense value, vent about industry standards, and position ourselves as the "Technical Saviors." Focus on r/entrepreneur, r/saas, r/startups.

## 👽 Post 1: The "Whistleblower" Analysis (r/entrepreneur)
**Title:** I audited 100 "Professional Agency" websites. The results are frankly embarrassing (and why you're probably getting ripped off).

**Copy:**
Hey everyone,

I’m a lead engineer at a dev shop, and last week I went down a rabbit hole. I wanted to see what the "big guys"—agencies charging $15k-$30k for a website—were actually delivering under the hood.

I ran 100 agency client sites through Google PageSpeed Insights and inspected their source code.
I wish I was joking about what I found.

**The Horror Show:**
1.  **Bloatware:** 80% were just heavy WordPress themes disguised as "custom code." One site loaded 14MB of unused JavaScript. 14MB!!
2.  **Fake Speed:** They use lazy-loading tricks to fool speed tests, but the "Time to Interactive" (when you can actually click stuff) was 4+ seconds. In e-commerce, that is a death sentence.
3.  **Zero SEO Structure:** no H1 tags, broken meta descriptions, generic alt text. Basically invisible to Google.

**Why this matters to you:**
If you are a founder, you are likely focusing on "Does it look pretty?"
You need to be asking: "Does it convert?"

**Three things you can check right now (for free) to see if your dev is lazy:**
1.  **Right Click -> Inspect -> Network Tab.** If your site transfer size is over 2MB, you have a problem.
2.  **Mobile Formatting.** Check your buttons on a heavily zoomed-in mobile screen. If they overlap, your responsive design is broken.
3.  **Lighthouse Score.** Don't settle for "green-ish." Demand 95+. It is 2025; next-gen frameworks like Next.js make this standard, not optional.

I’m tired of seeing good businesses fail because of bad tech.
We built a tool to auto-fix some of this, but honestly, you just need better standards.

Happy to answer any technical questions in the comments about your stack. (No, I won't DM you a pitch).

**TL;DR:** Most expensive agencies sell you WordPress bloat. Check your Lighthouse scores. Speed = Money.

## 👽 Post 2: The "AI Implementation" Case Study (r/SaaS)
**Title:** How we cut our client's support tickets by 70% using a $200 AI wrapper (Code Included).

**Copy:**
Too many people overcomplicate AI.
"We need a custom LLM! We need RAG pipelines!"

Sometimes, you just need a smart prompt and a good UI.

**The Problem:**
We had a client (E-comm vibe) drowning in "Where is my order?" and "Do you ship to Canada?" emails. 20 hours a week of manual replies.

**The Fix:**
We didn't build a complex brain. We built a simple "Neural" Chatbot on their Next.js site.
1.  **Context:** Fed it the last 50 answered emails + the FAQ page.
2.  **Personality:** Gave it a "Helpful Expert" system prompt.
3.  **Trigger:** Instead of a generic icon, we used a "pulsing" localized notification: "Hey [City], quick question?"

**The Result:**
Week 1: Intercepted 40% of queries.
Week 4: Intercepted 70% of queries.
The support team now only deals with actual refunds/complex issues.

**The Tech Stack:**
*   Next.js (Frontend)
*   Supabase (Vector Store)
*   OpenAI API (The brain)
*   Framer Motion (For that smooth UI feel)

It’s not magic. It’s just good engineering.
If you aren't using AI to filter the noise on your landing page, you are working too hard.

## 📢 Ad 1: The "Developer Venting" (Native Native)
**Headline:** POV: You hired a "Cheap" Developer on Upwork.
**Visual:** A meme. "Expectation: Iron Man suit. Reality: Cardboard box with foil."
**Copy:**
Stop fixing their bugs.
Stop apologizing for 404 errors.
Stop waiting 3 days for a text change.

We are the dev team you wish you hired the first time.
Next.js. 100/100 Speed. No excuses.

## 📢 Ad 2: The "Value Bomb" (Information Gap)
**Headline:** Your website is leaking revenue. Here is exactly where.
**Copy:**
(Text-only ad, looks like a post)

Most founders focus on traffic. Smart founders focus on the "Leaky Bucket."
If your site takes 3s to load, you lose 32% of traffic.
If your CTA isn't sticky, you lose 15%.
If you don't use Social Proof, you lose 20%.

We fix the bucket first. Then we turn on the hose.
