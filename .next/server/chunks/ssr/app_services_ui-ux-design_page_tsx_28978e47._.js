UI (User Interface) focuses on how the product looks - the visual design, colors, typography, and layout. Both are essential and work together. Think of UX as the blueprint and UI as the interior design."},{question:"How long does a UI/UX design project take?",answer:"Timeline depends on project scope and complexity. Simple landing pages or small apps take 3-4 weeks, while complex enterprise applications can take 8-12 weeks or more. We provide detailed timelines with milestones after understanding your requirements during the discovery phase."},{question:"Do you conduct user testing?",answer:"Absolutely! User testing is crucial to our process. We conduct moderated and unmoderated usability tests with real users (typically 5-8 participants per round) to validate designs and identify areas for improvement before development begins. This saves significant time and money by catching issues early."},{question:"Can you redesign my existing product?",answer:"Yes! We specialize in product redesigns and have helped over 150+ companies transform their digital products. We start with a comprehensive UX audit to analyze your current design, identify pain points and opportunities, then create improved experiences that drive better results while maintaining user familiarity where it matters."},{question:"Do you create design systems?",answer:"Yes! We create comprehensive design systems with reusable components, style guides, design tokens, and detailed documentation. This ensures consistency across your product, speeds up future development, and makes it easier to scale your team. We can work with tools like Figma, Sketch, or Storybook."},{question:"What tools do you use for UI/UX design?",answer:"Our primary tools include Figma for design and prototyping, Miro for collaboration and workshops, Maze or UserTesting for usability testing, Hotjar for analytics, and Dovetail for research synthesis. We adapt our toolset based on your existing workflow and preferences."},{question:"How do you measure the success of a design?",answer:"We measure success through both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Key metrics include: task completion rate, time on task, error rate, user satisfaction scores (SUS, NPS), conversion rates, and engagement metrics. We establish baseline metrics before redesign and track improvements post-launch."},{question:"Do you work with our existing development team?",answer:"Yes! We work seamlessly with in-house or third-party development teams. We provide detailed design specs, component documentation, asset exports, and ongoing support during implementation. We can also conduct design QA reviews to ensure the final product matches our designs."}],A=[{label:"Services",href:"/services"},{label:"UI/UX Design",href:"/services/ui-ux-design"}];function B(){return(0,v.useEffect)(()=>{window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:"instant"})},[]),(0,b.jsxs)("main",{className:"min-h-screen bg-background selection:bg-green-500/30",children:[(0,b.jsx)(i.ServiceSchema,{name:"UI/UX Design Services",description:"Professional UI/UX design services including user research, wireframing, prototyping, visual design, and usability testing.
