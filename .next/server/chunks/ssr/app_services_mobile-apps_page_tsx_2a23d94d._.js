Cross-platform (React Native or Flutter) is cost-effective, faster to develop (one codebase for iOS and Android), and perfect for MVPs or standard apps. Native (Swift/Kotlin) is best when you need platform-specific features, maximum performance, or complex animations. We recommend cross-platform for 80% of projects—it delivers 95% of native performance at 50% of the cost."},{question:"How long does mobile app development take?",answer:"Timeline varies by complexity. Simple apps (3-5 screens, basic features) take 8-12 weeks. Medium complexity apps (10-15 screens, API integration, user auth) require 16-20 weeks. Complex apps (real-time features, payments, advanced functionality) take 24+ weeks. We provide detailed timelines with milestones after understanding your requirements and adjust based on feedback during development."},{question:"Do you help with App Store and Google Play submission?",answer:"Yes! We handle the entire submission process for both Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This includes setting up developer accounts, preparing app store assets (screenshots, descriptions, keywords), ensuring compliance with store guidelines, managing the review process, and optimizing your app store listing (ASO) for maximum discoverability and downloads."},{question:"Can you integrate payment processing into my app?",answer:"Absolutely! We integrate all major payment providers: Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Braintree, and more. We handle subscription management, one-time purchases, in-app purchases (IAP), payment security compliance (PCI DSS), and transaction tracking. We also implement subscription tiers, trial periods, and promo codes if needed."},{question:"Will my app work offline?",answer:"Yes! We build offline-first apps that work without internet connection. Data is cached locally and automatically syncs when connectivity returns. This is crucial for user experience—users can view content, make edits, and perform actions even in poor network conditions. Perfect for travel apps, productivity tools, and areas with unreliable internet."},{question:"How do you ensure app security and data privacy?",answer:"Security is paramount. We implement: secure authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT), encrypted data storage, HTTPS-only API communication, secure key management, biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID), and regular security audits. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA (if needed), and follow OWASP mobile security guidelines. All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit."},{question:"Do you provide ongoing app maintenance and updates?",answer:"Yes! We offer comprehensive maintenance packages including: bug fixes, OS compatibility updates (when iOS/Android release new versions), security patches, performance monitoring, crash reporting and fixes, feature enhancements, and App Store Optimization updates. Maintenance packages start at $1,500/month and include priority support and monthly reports."},{question:"What is the cost to develop a mobile app?",answer:"App development costs vary widely based on complexity. Simple apps start around $25,000. Medium complexity apps range from $50,000-$100,000. Enterprise-grade apps with advanced features start at $150,000+. Cross-platform development costs 30-40% less than building separate native apps. We provide detailed estimates after a discovery session.
