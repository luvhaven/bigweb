Perfect if you need to launch quickly and have under 10,000 SKUs. Custom e-commerce (built with Next.js + Stripe/Shopify headless) is better when you need unique features, complex integrations, or highly custom user experiences. We recommend Shopify for 70% of projects due to lower cost and faster time-to-market.'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    question: 'How long does it take to build an e-commerce website?',\r\n    answer: 'Shopify stores take 4-8 weeks from kickoff to launch for standard setups, or 10-16 weeks for complex customizations and integrations. Custom-built e-commerce platforms require 12-24 weeks depending on features like subscription billing, multi-vendor marketplaces, or custom integrations. We provide detailed timelines with milestones after understanding your product catalog and requirements.'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    question: 'Can you migrate my existing store to a new platform?',\r\n    answer: 'Yes! We specialize in e-commerce migrations from WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, or custom platforms to Shopify or headless commerce. We migrate all products, customers, orders, and historical data while preserving SEO value through proper redirects. We also improve the design and conversion rate during migration. Typical migrations take 6-12 weeks depending on data volume.'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    question: 'What payment methods can I accept?',\r\n    answer: 'We integrate all major payment providers: Stripe (credit/debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay), PayPal, Square, Authorize.net, and local payment methods (Klarna, Afterpay for BNPL, Alipay for China, etc.). For Shopify, Shopify Payments is included. We also support subscription billing, partial payments, and multi-currency for international sales.'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    question: 'How do you optimize for mobile commerce?',\r\n    answer: 'With 70% of e-commerce traffic coming from mobile, we design mobile-first. This includes: thumb-friendly navigation, simplified checkout (as few steps as possible), mobile-optimized images, Apple Pay/Google Pay integration, and fast load times (under 2 seconds). We test on real devices (iPhone and Android) to ensure perfect experience across all screen sizes.'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    question: 'Can you help with SEO and digital marketing?',\r\n    answer: 'Yes! E-commerce SEO is built-in: optimized product titles and descriptions, schema markup for rich snippets, fast page speeds, mobile optimization, and clean URL structure. We also integrate marketing tools: email marketing (Klaviyo, Mailchimp), abandoned cart recovery, SMS marketing, social media pixels (Facebook, TikTok), and Google Analytics. We can also provide ongoing SEO and marketing services post-launch.'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    question: 'How do you handle inventory and order management?',\r\n    answer: 'We set up comprehensive inventory management: real-time stock tracking across multiple locations, low-stock alerts, automatic order fulfillment workflows, shipping label generation, and integration with fulfillment services (ShipStation, ShipBob).

For custom stores, we integrate with enterprise systems like NetSuite or custom warehouse management systems.'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    question: 'What are the costs for e-commerce development?',\r\n    answer: 'Shopify stores start at $15,000 for basic setup with theme customization, or $30,000-$60,000 for heavily customized stores with unique features. Custom e-commerce platforms start at $75,000 for mid-complexity sites, or $150,000+ for enterprise marketplaces with advanced features.
