We're engineering revenue systems.

Here's what that means for you:

✅ Every pixel has a purpose

We don't do "creative" for the sake of art.
We do conversion engineering for the sake of your bottom line.

New offerings:
→ $399 Conversion Diagnostic (48hr turnaround)

### Post 2: Problem/Solution
```
Your website is beautiful.

It's also broke.

Here's the brutal truth:

→ 97% of visitors leave without converting
→ Your bounce rate is 70%+
→ Mobile users can't find your CTA
→ Your forms have 12 fields (should be 3)
→ Your value prop takes 30 seconds to understand

Pretty doesn't pay the bills.

Conversion does.

At The Conversion Lab, we fix the 20% of issues causing 80% of your revenue loss.

In 7 days.

Starting at $1,000.

Stop losing money to bad UX.

DM me "FIX" for details.

### Post 3: Case Study Teaser
```
We increased a SaaS company's conversion rate by 127%.

In 6 months.

Without redesigning a single page.

How?

We fixed 3 things:

1. Simplified their value proposition (from 47 words to 7)
2. Removed 9 form fields (kept only email)
3. Added social proof above the fold

That's it.

No fancy animations.
No expensive redesign.
No 6-month project.

Just surgical precision on what actually matters.

This is conversion engineering.

### Post 4: Educational
```
The 5-Second Test:

Can someone understand what you do in 5 seconds?

If not, you're losing money.

Here's how to fix it:

1. Open your homepage
2. Set a timer for 5 seconds
3. Ask someone: "What does this company do?"

If they can't answer clearly, your value prop is broken.

The fix:

[WHO YOU HELP] + [WHAT YOU DO] + [OUTCOME THEY GET]

Example:
❌ "We leverage cutting-edge solutions to optimize digital experiences"
✅ "We help SaaS companies double their trial-to-paid conversion rate"

See the difference?

One is jargon.
One is money.

## Twitter/X Threads

### Thread 1: The Conversion Lab Launch
```
🧵 We just rebranded from a digital agency to a conversion lab.

Here's why (and what it means for you):

1/8

Most agencies sell you on "beautiful design" and "brand identity."

We sell you on revenue.

Because at the end of the day, your website has one job: convert visitors into customers.

2/8

The problem?

Most websites are optimized for awards, not conversions.

They look great in portfolios.
They suck at selling.

3/8

So we became The Conversion Lab.

We don't do "creative."
We do conversion engineering.

Every decision is backed by:
→ Psychology
→ Data
→ Testing

4/8

Our new offerings:

💰 $399 Diagnostic (48hr)
⚡ $1k Fix Sprint (7 days)
🏗️ $3k+ Revenue System (8 weeks)
📈 $500-2k/mo Retainer (ongoing)

5/8

Why these prices?

Because we're not selling hours.
We're selling outcomes.

A $399 diagnostic that increases your conversion rate by 20% is worth $10k+ in revenue.

That's a 25x ROI.

6/8

Who is this for?

→ SaaS companies with traffic but no conversions
→ E-commerce stores with high bounce rates
→ Service businesses with broken funnels
→ Startups ready to scale

7/8

Who is this NOT for?

→ Companies with zero traffic
→ Businesses without product-market fit
→ People who want "pretty" over "profitable"

8/8

### Thread 2: Why Your Website Isn't Converting
```
🧵 Your website gets 10,000 visitors/month.

Only 50 convert.

That's a 0.5% conversion rate.

Here's why (and how to fix it):

1/10

Reason #1: Your value proposition is unclear.

Visitors land on your site and think:
"What do they actually do?"

The fix:
Make it crystal clear in 5 seconds or less.

[WHO] + [WHAT] + [OUTCOME]

2/10

Reason #2: Your CTA is invisible.

I've seen websites where I had to scroll 3 times to find the "Get Started" button.

The fix:
Put your primary CTA above the fold.
Make it contrast with the background.
Use action words.

3/10

Reason #3: Too many form fields.

Every field you add reduces conversions by 10-20%.

The fix:
Ask for the minimum.
Email only? Even better.
You can get the rest later.

4/10

Reason #4: No social proof.

People don't trust you yet.

The fix:
Add testimonials.
Show client logos.
Display real numbers.

"Join 10,000+ customers" > "Sign up today"

5/10

Reason #5: Slow load time.

Every second of delay = 7% fewer conversions.

The fix:
Compress images.
Remove unnecessary scripts.
Use a CDN.

Target: <3 seconds.

6/10

Reason #6: Mobile experience sucks.

60% of traffic is mobile.
But your site was designed for desktop.

The fix:
Test on real devices.
Increase button sizes.
Simplify navigation.

7/10

Reason #7: No urgency.

Why should I buy today vs. next month?

The fix:
Limited-time offers.
Scarcity (only X spots left).
Risk reversal (money-back guarantee).

8/10

Reason #8: You're talking about features, not benefits.

"AI-powered analytics dashboard" ❌
"Know exactly which customers will churn" ✅

The fix:
Benefits > Features
Outcomes > Capabilities

9/10

Reason #9: Broken trust.

No privacy policy.
No contact info.
No about page.
Stock photos everywhere.

The fix:
Be real. Be transparent.
Show your face. Share your story.

10/10
