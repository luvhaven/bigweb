# Phase 2 Complete - Content Updates ✅

## Summary
Phase 2 focused on refining messaging, removing confusing sections, and optimizing content placement for better conversion.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Removed "Outcomes, Not Services" Section ✅

**File**: `/src/components/ConversionOffers.tsx`

**Before**:
```
Outcomes, Not Services
We don't sell "web design" or "code". We sell engineered systems that capture value.
Choose your level of engagement.
```

**After**:
```
Choose Your Path to Higher Conversions
From quick diagnostics to complete rebuilds—pick the solution that fits your timeline and budget.
```

**Why This Works Better**:
- ✅ More direct and action-oriented
- ✅ Doesn't conflict with offer page messaging
- ✅ Clearer value proposition
- ✅ Easier to understand

---

### 2. Updated "Engineers, Not Artists" Section ✅

**File**: `/src/components/AuthoritySection.tsx`

#### Change 1: Removed "Next.js Elite"
**Before**: "Next.js Elite"  
**After**: "Performance Obsessed"

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Outcome-focused (performance) not tool-focused (Next.js)
- ✅ More accessible to non-technical clients
- ✅ Emphasizes what matters: speed = conversions

#### Change 2: Updated Image
**Before**: Generic team photo  
**After**: Analytics/data dashboard image

**Why**:
- ✅ Better represents "conversion engineering"
- ✅ Shows data-driven approach
- ✅ More relevant to messaging

---

### 3. Moved Live Statistics to High-Impact Position ✅

**File**: `/app/page.tsx`

**Before**: Bottom of page (after footer, floating)  
**After**: Right after hero section

**New Homepage Flow**:
1. Hero (hook)
2. **Live Stats** ← NEW POSITION
3. Problem/Solution
4. Client Marquee
5. Offers
6. Tech Stack
7. Process
8. Authority
9. Testimonials
10. Final CTA
11. Footer

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Immediate social proof after hero
- ✅ Builds trust early in the journey
- ✅ Higher visibility = more impact
- ✅ Supports hero claims with data

**Expected Impact**: 10-15% increase in scroll depth and engagement
