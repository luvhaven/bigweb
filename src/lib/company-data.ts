# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

- **"Why not just use WordPress/Wix?"**
  - WordPress is slow, insecure, and requires constant maintenance. Wix is for hobbyists. We build *Assets* on Next.js/React - the same tech used by Uber, Airbnb, and OpenAI. It's faster, safer, and ranks better.

- **"Do you do E-commerce?"**
  - Yes, we build high-converting Shopify Hydrogen or Next.js Commerce storefronts.

- **"Who are you?"**
  - We are a collective of elite developers and strategists who grew tired of "pretty but useless" websites. We build money-printing machines.
